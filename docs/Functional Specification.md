# Functional Specification




## Background: The problem being addressed

Our goal is to help independent retailers have easy access to some powerful analytics. Independent retailers, constrained by logistics 
and storage, can outmaneuver larger competitors by leveraging this application. It uses customer reviews from these competitors 
to identify trending products, enabling small businesses to optimize inventory strategically. This approach turns logistical challenges into a 
competitive advantage, facilitating informed decisions to stay ahead in the market. Our solution is a streamlined interface for retailers to analyze customer feedback 
and refine product offerings. It supports searching and filtering by categories, brands, and ratings, enabling insights into customer preferences and sentiment

## User profile. Who uses the system? What they know about the domain and computing?

The user of the system does not need to be a developer, but they need to have some technical proficiency. This tool is an analysis tool, and is intended to be used by 
someone who has the skills of a data analyst at the minimum. The data analyst, even if not familiar with programming languages, will still be able to get the insights. 
The reach goal for this project is to be able to have some type of basic UI in the browser, at the very least have it be some type of a graphical user interface. In that
case, a data analyst level of computing knowledge will not even be required. But, for the user profile we will assume the worst case, which is that our end UI will be 
the terminal interface. There will be good enough documentation and a data analyst will be able to use the tool. 

## Data sources. What data you will use and how it is structured?

We will be using an Amazon customer review dataset from Kaggle. Luckily this dataset is very well documented on that website. It has all of the information 
that you need to know as well as a schema, some sample rows and some basic metrics. It is also a very well maintained and clean dataset with many example notebooks.
