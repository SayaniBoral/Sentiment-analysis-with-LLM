# Code Reviews

While this project was complicated and involved the application of software engineering skills, we found it sufficient to review code as a group. Since there were only three of us and there was not much that could be worked on in parallel, we decided to meet once a week and do a code review as well as discuss the project in general. 
We also reviewed eachothers notebooks during standups. All team members also pulled the tests and tried to improve them. Everything was run through pylint as well. 

## Meeting Minutes 2/10

Go over notebook on how to extract and filter dataset. 

The notebook looked good and the code was straightforward. Some suggestions were to make copies of dataframes vs. directly reassigning them. 


## Meeting Minutes 2/17

Review initial user input notebook. Ran through all of the cells and decided to turn some of the cells into functions. We agreed that breaking the large code block up into smaller functions helps us with debugging and makes the code more readable. 


## Meeting Minutes 2/24

Go over the streamlit application code and get it to run properly. Work on algo to parse the LLAMA output and extract the necessary information. 
Work on pseudocode for ranking algo used for top 5 and bottom 5 products.
