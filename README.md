# Sentiment-analysis-with-LLM

## Project Overview
This project aims to leverage the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to conduct sentiment analysis on customer reviews. Our primary objective is to understand the sentiment embedded in the feedback provided by customers on various platforms about our product/service. Through this analysis, we intend to gain insights into customer satisfaction, preferences, and expectations to improve our offerings and address any potential issues.

## Project Type
This initiative is an analytical project focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis. We will utilize advanced LLMs to interpret and classify the sentiments expressed in customer reviews, categorizing them into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.

## Questions of Interest
- What is the overall sentiment of the customer reviews regarding our product/service?
- Are there any recurring themes in the negative or positive feedback provided by customers?
- How do sentiments vary across different platforms or product categories?
- Can we identify any trends in customer sentiment over time?
- How does the sentiment analysis inform our product development and customer service strategies?


## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to produce a comprehensive sentiment analysis report detailing the sentiments expressed in customer reviews. This report will include:

- Quantitative metrics summarizing the overall sentiment distribution.
- Qualitative insights into the themes and trends observed within the feedback.
- Recommendations for addressing areas of concern highlighted by negative sentiments.
- Suggestions for capitalizing on strengths as indicated by positive feedback.
- Additionally, we aim to develop a sentiment analysis model or tool that can automate the process of categorizing customer sentiments for ongoing analysis and monitoring.

# Data Sources
To conduct this analysis, we will utilize customer reviews from a variety of sources, including: /
Kaggle Amazon Reviews Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews /
Kaggle reviews of Amazon Branded Products: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products /
HUGE 1GB Amazon Reviews Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritanjalijain/amazon-reviews

Methodology
Our approach will involve the following steps:

- Data Collection: Aggregating customer reviews from the identified source (most likely just use a Kaggle Dataset)
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- Sentiment Analysis: Applying LLMs to analyze the sentiment of each review.
- Data Visualization: Creating visual representations of the sentiment analysis results.
- Report Generation: Compiling the findings and insights into a comprehensive report.

## Tools and Technologies
LLMs for sentiment analysis: OpenAI's GPT-3 and GPT-4, Google's BERT, or similar models.
Data collection and preprocessing tools: Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup for web scraping, Pandas for data manipulation.
Data visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, or similar libraries for graphical representation.
Report generation: Jupyter Notebooks or Markdown for documentation and presentation of findings.
